Curve StableSwap Exchange: Deposit Contracts
============================================

Curve pools may rely on a different contract, called a *deposit zap* for the addition and removal of underlying coins. This is particularly useful for lending pools, which may only support the addition/removal of wrapped coins. Furthermore, deposit zaps are also useful for metapools, which do not support the addition/removal of base pool coins.

Lending Pool Deposits
=====================

While Curve lending pools support swaps in both the wrapped *and* underlying coins, not all lending pools allow liquidity providers to deposit or withdraw the underlying coin.

For example, the Compound Pool allows swaps between ``cDAI`` and ``cUSDC`` (wrapped coins), as well as swaps between ``DAI`` and ``USDC`` (underlying coins). However, liquidity providers are not able to deposit ``DAI`` or ``USDC`` to the pool directly. The main reason for why this is not supported by all Curve lending pools lies in the `size limit of contracts <https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-170.md>`_. Lending pools may differ in complexity and can end up being very close to the contract byte code size limit. In order to overcome this restriction, liquidity can be added and removed to and from a lending pool in the underlying coins via a different contract, called a *deposit zap*, tailored to lending pools.

For an overview of the Curve lending pool implementation, please refer to the :ref:`Lending Pool <exchange-pools-lending>` section.

The template source code for a lending pool deposit zap may be viewed on `GitHub <https://github.com/curvefi/curve-contract/blob/master/contracts/pool-templates/y/DepositTemplateY.vy>`_.


.. note::
    Lending pool deposit zaps may differ in their API. Older pools do not implement the newer `API template <https://github.com/curvefi/curve-contract/blob/master/contracts/pool-templates/y/DepositTemplateY.vy>`_.


Deposit Zap API (OLD)
--------------------

Older Curve lending pool deposit zaps do not implement the `template API <https://github.com/curvefi/curve-contract/blob/master/contracts/pool-templates/y/DepositTemplateY.vy>`_. The deposit zaps which employ an older API are:

    * ``DepositBUSD``: `BUSD pool deposit zap <https://etherscan.io/address/0xb6c057591e073249f2d9d88ba59a46cfc9b59edb#code>`_
    * ``DepositCompound``: `Compound pool deposit zap <https://etherscan.io/address/0xeb21209ae4c2c9ff2a86aca31e123764a3b6bc06#code>`_
    * ``DepositPAX``: `PAX pool deposit zap <https://etherscan.io/address/0xa50ccc70b6a011cffddf45057e39679379187287#code>`_
    * ``DepositUSDT``: `USDT pool deposit zap <https://etherscan.io/address/0xac795d2c97e60df6a99ff1c814727302fd747a80#code>`_
    * ``DepositY``: `Y pool deposit zap <https://etherscan.io/address/0xbbc81d23ea2c3ec7e56d39296f0cbb648873a5d3#readContract>`_

While not a lending pool, note that the following contract also implements the newer deposit zap API:

    * ``DepositSUSD``: `SUSD pool deposit zap <https://etherscan.io/address/0xfcba3e75865d2d561be8d220616520c171f12851#code>`_


Get Deposit Zap Information
***************************

.. note::
    Getters generated for public arrays changed between Vyper ``0.1.x`` and ``0.2.x`` to accept ``uint256`` instead of ``int128`` in order to handle the lookups. Older deposit zap contracts (v1) use ``vyper 0.1.x...``, while newer zaps (v2) use ``vyper 0.2.x...``.

Metapool Deposits
=================

While Curve metapools support swaps between base pool coins, the base pool LP token and metapool coins, they do not allow liquidity providers to deposit and/or withdraw base pool coins.

For example, the GUSD metapool is a pool consisting of ``GUSD`` and ``3CRV`` (the LP token of the 3Pool) and allows for swaps between ``GUSD``, ``DAI``, ``USDC``, ``USDT`` and ``3CRV``. However, liquidity providers are not able to deposit ``DAI``, ``USDC`` or ``USDT`` to the pool directly. The main reason why this is not possible lies in the maximum byte code size of contracts. Metapools are complex and can therefore end up being very close to the contract byte code size limit. In order to overcome this restriction, liquidity can be added and removed to and from a metapool in the base pool's coins through a metapool deposit zap.

For an overview of the Curve metapool implementation, please refer to the :ref:`Metapool <exchange-pools-meta>` section.

The template source code for a metapool deposit "zap" may be viewed on `GitHub <https://github.com/curvefi/curve-contract/blob/master/contracts/pool-templates/meta/DepositTemplateMeta.vy>`_.

A list of all deployed metapool deposit zaps can be found :ref:`here <addresses-metapools>`.

.. note::
    Metapool deposit zaps contain the following private and hardcoded constants:

    * ``N_COINS``: Number of coins in the metapool (excluding base pool coins)
    * ``BASE_N_COINS``: Number of coins in the base pool
    * ``N_ALL_COINS``: All coins in the metapool, excluding the base pool LP token (``N_COINS + BASE_N_COINS - 1``)
